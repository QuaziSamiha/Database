**4 April, 25**

- find customers who have placed more than 2 orders and calculate the total amount spent by each of these customers.

- find the total amount of orders placed each month in the year 2022

## 53-2 Exploring Subqueries

- a subquery is a nested query within another SQL statement.

## 53-3 Utilizing Subqueries in Different Clauses

## 53-4 Exploring Views in PostgreSQL

- views are virtual tables generated from the result of a SQL query
- what is the purpose of SQL views?
  - simplifying complex queries
  - improved security
  - enhanced data abstraction

## 53-5 Exploring Functions in PostgreSQL

- sql works in a declarative way
- declarative means to know what to do, not how to do
- imperative means to know how to do
- procedural = imperative
- non-procedural = declarative

- procedural approach:

  - language support: supports procedural languages like PL/pgSQL, PL/Perl, PL/Python etc.
  - complex logic: Allows for complex logic using control structures like loops, conditionals , and exception handling.
  - variable support: supports variable declarations and manipulation within the procedural code.
  - stored procedures/functions: provides the ability to create stored procedures or functions.

- non-procedural approach:
  - declarative queries: focuses on writing declarative SQL queries to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data from the database.
  - simplicity: emphasizes simplicity by expressing operations in terms of what data is needed.
  - SQL functions: supports sql functions, which are single sql statements that return a value or set of values.
  - performance: can sometimes offer better performance for simple operations due to the optimized query execution plans generated by the database.
